1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
One way to create a JavaScript Object is by using Object Literal. This involves defining the property and values inside curly braces. Another method is to use Constructor which is a function that creates multiple objects of the same kind using the new keyword. Similarly, you can use the JavaScript keyword new to create a new JavaScript object with multiple properties.
